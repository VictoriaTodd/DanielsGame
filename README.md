# Daniel's Game

A simple game created with Processing. Catch the chips, iced coffee and pumpkin pie, but look out for the whales!

To play, either run the processing code from within the Processing IDE, or export for the OS of your choice.
The player is controlled with the left and right arrow keys. The aim is to gain as many points as possible: chips increase points by 5 points, iced coffees by 10 points and pies by 25 points. Whales take away points, taking more amd more as the game progresses. If your points drop below 0, the game ends!

<b>Some notes on the code:</b>
I created this game around April 2018, as such some things aren't exactly how I would do them now. In particular, I'd like to update the tracking of game states to use a single variable instead of both startscreen and endscreen, based on what I have learnt from taking Event Driven Computing. Future updates may also include more levels, high scores and better graphics - stay tuned!
